# Integrating-Reinforcement-Learning-with-WEC-Sim-for-Enhanced-Performance
Research integrates RL with WEC-Sim for optimized wave energy conversion, focusing on dynamic ocean conditions and improving WEC efficiency using machine learning.

Disclaimers: 
  1. Make Sure You Have Downloaded The File WEC-Sim-master file from any source then put the MATLAB file: "wecSimInputFile.TEMPLATE.m" into the directory: "WEC-Sim-master/examples/RM3". (You have to set the director where you put the WEC-Sim-master folder).
  2. Also it is recommended for MAC users to use a computer with a **3.2 GHz 8-Core Intel Xeon W** Processor. This is because you need to instal the **matlab_engine()** code and recent processors such as **M2 Pro** does not support
